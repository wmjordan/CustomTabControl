# CustomTabControl
A highly customizable TabControl for WinForms. Originated from https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/91387/Painting-Your-Own-Tabs-Second-Edition-2

# About this fork
The original version does a great job to provide a fantastic TabControl for WinForms.

However, it has some bugs or limitations, for instance, the UI thread will consume a whole CPU core when the control is clipped and repainted; 
it does not support hi-DPI monitors well thus the close buttons on tabs can be very small.
Unfortunately, the author, nick named "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." on CodeProject, appeared to cease updating the project.
Thus I adopted some modifications from the other users and fixed some by my own.

Here's the code and you can download a working assembly from the Relase page.
